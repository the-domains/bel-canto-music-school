I have 8 years of experience of teaching piano from beginner level through to grade 8\.

I have taught violin for the last 2 years from beginner level to Grade 6\.

I teach both children and adults. Currently I have a mix of children who started as beginners and adults who are returning to instrumental lessons after a break.

In previous years I have also taught adult beginners and a retired gentleman who used to learn piano during his childhood.

Additionally, I have experience of teaching 4 autistic children the piano.

I am a violinist with four orchestras - a full symphony orchestra specialising in performing late classical and 21st century music, another which performs pure classical programmes, a chamber orchestra and an orchestra which performs a range of styles from Hendrix to various music for film. I also play with a folk/rock band and have done recording work in the studio with singer songwriters.
