I charge £30 for an hour long lesson.

A 40 minute lesson is £20\.

I offer the option of a 30 minute lesson at £15 for children under 7 years of age.

If lessons take place from your home, I charge a minimum travel fee of £5 and this adjusts upwards according to distance and ease of route to your location.
