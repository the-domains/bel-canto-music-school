I am open to taking pupils from 4-5 years up to any age. Very young beginners follow a special pedagogical programme.

My belief is that it is never too late to learn or return to learning!

Children who have just started school usually benefit from a parent/carer attending the initial lessons until they are familiar with me. Subsequently it is helpful if parents/carers are willing to spend 5 minutes or so at the beginning or end of each lesson for any messages to be discussed.

From 6 years children need to be happy to attend their lessons alone.

I encourage parents/carers to meet for an initial meeting and will regularly discuss their child's progress and practice.

Currently I teach up to Grade 8 piano and Grade 6 violin.
