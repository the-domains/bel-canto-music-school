Hello! I have a passion for teaching music and my motivation is in helping you achieve your goal. My approach is to enable and encourage. I can guide you on how to make progress and gain enjoyment from playing an instrument.

I teach the piano and violin. I am also able to teach music theory and like to do this by integrating aural awareness via keyboard knowledge.
