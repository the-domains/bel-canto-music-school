I hope to make music an important part of my pupils' lives. So I always aim to give my pupils a goal and something to inspire them each lesson. If there is something specific any of my pupils want to ask or know about I always listen and take their views and interests into account. I would say that my approach to lessons is organised yet my teaching also takes place within a flexible frame.

If you are keen to learn the piano or violin, or want to gain knowledge about theory of music, then I can help you achieve your goals.

I regularly perform in 4 orchestras, play violin in a band and attend concerts and gigs of all musical styles from baroque to rock, jazz to hip hop and experimental music!

Being a pianist, my violin pupils benefit from regular good quality piano accompaniment and the opportunity to play duets.
